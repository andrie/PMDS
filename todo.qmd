## to do


- Who is the user of PowerBi migration?
- How do you get your collaborators to use version control?
- PM vs SWE concerns
- Add triad of designer, PM and dev lead
- Maybe more examples of things that turned into products (at end)

- recreate product strategy image

Consider cutting out:

- the adoption curve
- crossing the chasm
- remove prioritisation from product strategy slide
