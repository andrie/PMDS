## Marketing analytics

Data scientists have many tools that are useful for product management. 

I have used:

-   `{forecast}`

-   `{mlogit}` for discrete choice analysis (conjoint and maxdiff)

-   `kmeans` clustering (base R)

-   `{LCA}` (latent class analysis)

-   `{lda}` and `{topicmodels}` for topic modeling

-   `{survival}` for modeling ad effectiveness

-   `{keras}` and `{tensorflow}` for predicting support ticket complexity
