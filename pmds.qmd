# Agenda

What is product management?

Why should you care as a data scientist?

What next?


# My product management journey

## My journey

Psion

Revolution R Open

Microsoft R Open

MRAN

Posit Workbench

## Marketing analytics

Data scientists have many tools that are useful for product management. I have used:

- `{forecast}`

- `{conjoint}` for discrete choice analysis

- `kmeans` clustering (base R)

- `{lca}` (latent class analysis)

- `{LDA}` for topic modeling 

- `{survival}` for modeling ad effectiveness

- `{keras}` and `{tensorflow}` for predicting support ticket complexity

## Product life cycle

## Crossing the chasm

## Product strategy

The goal of product strategy is to define a sequence of outcomes (the plan) based on analysis of:

- the target customer, 
- the market environment and 
- the strategic objectives and needs of \<your company\>

## Value proposition

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

# The data scientist as PM

## Think of your app is a product

- Your app is a product

- Your internal audience is your customer

- You must convince users to change their habit to use your product

- This switching cost is the “price”

> *The biggest obstacle to adoption is inertia*
>
> - Paraphrased from April Dunford


## How to convince them?

- Case study: going from PowerBI to shiny dashboard

- Talk to users before you build it?

- Don't build it for you!!!

- What does 10x mean for you?

  - Super easy?

  - More up to date?

  - Faster?

  - More easily sharable?

  - ...

- Symbian dashboard

- Make sure they can discover your updates


Addtional things as you grow

- Understand the customer

- Jobs to be done

- Qual research

- Quant research

- Forums (gmail groups, slack, discord, reddit, youtube, ....)




## Examples of project that turned into products

- data.table

- ropensci

- tidyverse

- H2O.ai
