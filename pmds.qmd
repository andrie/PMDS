## Marketing analytics

Data scientists have many tools that are useful for product management. 

I have used:

-   `{forecast}`

-   `{mlogit}` for discrete choice analysis (conjoint and maxdiff)

-   `kmeans` clustering (base R)

-   `{LCA}` (latent class analysis)

-   `{lda}` and `{topicmodels}` for topic modeling

-   `{survival}` for modeling ad effectiveness

-   `{keras}` and `{tensorflow}` for predicting support ticket complexity

## Product life cycle

## The adoption cycle

## Crossing the chasm

# But how do you do that?

![](images/question-mark.drawio.png)

## Define your value proposition

Your product must create gain and reduce pain.

## Jobs to be done

> Jobs Theory goes beyond superficial categories to expose the functional, social, and emotional dimensions that explain why customers make the choices they do.
>
> - <https://www.christenseninstitute.org/jobs-to-be-done/>


</br>

A framework by Clayton Christensen and Bob Moesta

## Jobs to be done

Use JTBD as the first step in the value proposition:

-   What **activity** must be completed?

-   What is the **current way** to do that?

-   What are the **pain points** with the current way?

-   What can be **gained** by doing it differently?

## Product strategy

The goal of product strategy is to define a sequence of outcomes (the plan) based on analysis of:

-   the target customer,
-   the market environment and
-   the strategic objectives and needs of \<your company\>

# The data scientist as Product Manager

## Think of your app as a product

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Your app is a product

-   Your internal audience is your customer

-   You must convince users to change their habit to use your product

-   This switching cost is the “price”

## How to convince your users?

-   Example:

    -  going from PowerBI to shiny dashboard

</br>

-   Talk to users before you build it?

-   Don't build it for you!!!

## The 10-x exercise

-   What does 10x mean for your product?

    -   Super easy?

    -   More up to date?

    -   Faster?

    -   More easily sharable?

    -   ...


## Addtional things as you grow your product

-   Understand the customer

-   Qualitative research

    -   Interviews, focus groups, observation

-   Quant research

    - Survey

    - Questionnaire

-   Forums (gmail groups, slack, discord, reddit, youtube, ....)

## Examples of projects that turned into products
